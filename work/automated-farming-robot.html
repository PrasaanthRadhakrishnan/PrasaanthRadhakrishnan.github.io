                            <strong>What is Radio Frequency?</strong><br/><br/>
                            Radiofrequency (RF) is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or a magnetic, electric, or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz. This is roughly between the upper limit of audio frequencies and the lower limit of infrared frequencies. These are the frequencies at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a conductor into space as radio waves. Different sources specify different upper and lower bounds for the frequency range.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Electric currents that oscillate at radio frequencies (RF currents) have special properties not shared by direct current or lower audio frequency alternating current, such as the 50 or 60 Hz current used in electrical power distribution.

                    <strong>Project Introduction:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In India, there are 70% of people dependent on agriculture. Robotics plays a major role in various fields such as industrial, medical, military applications, etc., The robotics field is gradually increasing its productivity in the agriculture field. Some of the major problems in Indian agriculture are rising input costs, availability of skilled laborers, lack of water resources, and crop monitoring. To overcome these problems, automation technologies were used in agriculture. Automation in agriculture could help farmers to reduce their efforts. With the development of these robots lot of manual labor will also be decreased.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The robot has been developed for the processes such as plowing and seed sowing. The robot is developed to concentrate efficiently and also it is expected to perform the operations autonomously. These functions can be integrated into a single robot and then performed. In recent years, the development of autonomous vehicles in agriculture has experienced increased interest. This development has led many researchers to start developing more rational and adaptable vehicles. All the processes are advanced to modify the mechanism in farming which works automatically without the manpower requirement.</p>

                    <strong>Background:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The present project aims at designing an intelligent robotic vehicle that can be controlled wirelessly through RF communication. The objective is to develop a microcontroller-based system that helps in farm activities like seeding, plowing, and closing the seed pit designated the autonomous robot. The process of seeding is done by using the DC motor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim is to reduce the manpower and increase the productivity rates to a higher level. It is also efficient in terms of pollution because it does not run on fossil fuels, in turn reducing the consumption of ever-depleting natural resources. This makes the robot a non-polluting vehicle. One of the other aims is to reduce the running cost of digging or plowing machines which makes it more suitable for farmers in India to afford them.

                    <strong>Working of the Project:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An RF transmitter module is a small PCB sub-assembly capable of transmitting a radio wave and modulating that wave to carry data. Transmitter modules are usually implemented alongside a microcontroller which will provide data to the module which can be transmitted. RF transmitters are usually subject to requirements that dictate the maximum allowable transmitter power output, harmonics, and band edge requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An RF receiver module receives the modulated RF signal and demodulates it. There are two types of RF receiver modules: superheterodyne receivers and super-regenerative receivers. Super-regenerative modules are usually low-cost and low-power designs using a series of amplifiers to extract modulated data from a carrier wave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the transmitter part a data Encoder and an RF transmitter are used. The four push buttons are connected with the Encoder concerning the ground. When we will press any button encoder will get a digital LOW signal and then apply this signal serially to the RF transmitter. The Encoder IC HT12E encodes data or signal or converts it into serial form and then sends this signal by using an RF transmitter into the environment.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>At the receiver end we have used an RF receiver to receive data or signal and then applied it to the HT12D decoder. This decoder IC converts the received serial data to parallel and then sends this decoded signal to L293D Motor driver IC. According to the received data robot runs by using two dc motors in forward, reverse, left, right, and stop directions.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>As the robot moves forward the digging of the ground is done by using a structure made using sheet metal and connected to a stepper motor which starts as soon as it gets commands from the Arduino module.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>The seed container is spaced at an equal and calculated distance from these structures and is held using a rod holder. The seeds are sown in the dug hole by using a thermocouple having a hole and rotating using a servo motor. A container is used for holding the seeds. A hole is drilled in the bottom of the container so that the seeds can fall through it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Results:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this work, a robot, a farm robot, has been designed, built, and demonstrated to carry out plowing in an agriculture field and sowing seeds. It is expected that robots will assist the farmers in improving the efficiency of operations on their farms. It is aimed at increasing productivity and reducing the labor involved, this robot is designed to execute the basic functions required to be carried out on farms. The robot performs the tasks like digging the ground, sowing the seeds, and backfilling the soil automatically in a sequence without human intervention. Thus an effort is made so that the robot becomes an aid to the farmers. The design is accepted and unique compared to the existing robots.
