                            <strong>Overview of Software Development</strong><br/><br/>
                            Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development involves writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all processes from the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, typically in a planned and structured process. Software development also includes research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.

                    <strong>My Experience:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was first exposed to programming in the first year of my undergraduate degree where I worked on C Programming. I was very interested in it and picked up other programming courses there which were Data Structures and OOPS in C++, Embedded C, Advanced Embedded Controllers, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started making use of Data Structures frequently in C++ and learning the basics of Java. I implemented basic Python blocks of Code for an Arduino Controlled Farming Robot. I also worked on implementing a project to read handwritten numbers using machine learning by making use of Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the two years, I worked at Lumen (formerly known as CenturyLink), I was trained in Java Programming for two months. My work frequently required me to debug the pre-existing Web Services for getting the customer data that was entered on the web pages. I also wrote one Web Service completely which made use of Postman for various CRED operations like GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, and PATCH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my Graduate Studies at San Jose State University, I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering. I have completed courses like  Computer Architecture and Operating systems, I am currently pursuing a course in System Software and all these subjects are majorly involved in Coding in Embedded C and C. I have also completed a course in Data Structures and OOP using C++. I have also taken courses in Data Mining and Machine Learning which majorly include programming with Python.
