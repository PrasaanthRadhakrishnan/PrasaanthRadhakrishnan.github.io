                            <strong>Overview of COVID-19 Vaccination</strong><br/><br/>
                            The COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States is an ongoing mass immunization campaign for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 2020, and mass vaccinations began four days later.
                            <br/><br/>As of March 2022, according to The Commonwealth Fund, COVID-19 vaccination in the United States has prevented an additional 2.3 million deaths, an additional 17 million hospitalizations, and an additional 66.2 million infections from COVID-19. Vaccination has also prevented an additional $899.4 billion in healthcare costs.

                    <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 is a contagious disease which is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) and is the reason for millions of deaths around the globe. This is no doubt one of the biggest pandemics the world has ever seen. Our project studied the effects of various vaccines on patients and their progress. Even though this paper also includes various datasets, it primarily studies the effects of the vaccine in California, U.S. The data starts from the 5th of January 2020 to the 9th of March 2022. The dataset would be expanded in the future for better analysis and results. It also includes the various steps involved in data mining which is pre-processing, encoding, scaling the data, and building an algorithm that would predict the best results for the datasets.

                    The datasets that we used had over 40,000 rows of data in it and it required a lot of preprocessing. We dealt with handing the null values in the following way:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the dataset had multiple rows with multiple "NaN" values missing. In this case, dropping those rows would be the best solution</li>
                        <li>If the dataset has a feature with multiple “NaNs”, then there could be multiple solutions to it such as replacing them with a completely new value, replacing them with the most occurring value, replacing them with zeroes or with the mean or median values.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We encoded the data using Label Encoders as our data had both Nominal variables and categorical variables. Scaling the data is one of the most important steps when it comes to preprocessing the data and we decided to go with a 'Min-Max Scaler' for standardizing our data. The standardizing formula is given as follows:
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;">
                    <em>X_std = (X - X.min) / (X.max - X.min)</em><br/><br/>
                    <em>X_scaled = X_std * (max - min) + min</em><br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used various classifiers like Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. It was tested using 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold and 5 fold cross validation techniques. The results we obtained after training our data with the models listed are as follows:

                    Although the COVID situation has been alleviated by vaccines today, the virus is evolving with the development of vaccines. So, we are never too sure our health is secure from getting one. Therefore, this research of analyzing the impact of COVID is important. It’s crucial for people to know when and where the outbreak will happen again. In this practice, we have only used a small size of data samples. For better predictions and forecasting, we plan on analyzing data with bigger size. In addition, to fit the large amount of data, the model will be changed to deep learning with neural networks.
