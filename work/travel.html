                    <strong>Interest in Traveling:</strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    I have a strong interest in traveling and exploring new places. The idea of experiencing different cultures, trying new foods, and seeing new sights is incredibly exciting to me. 
                    I appreciate the opportunity to gain new perspectives and to challenge my own assumptions and biases. I find that traveling helps me to step out of my comfort zone and to learn more about myself. 
                    My passion for discovering new places, and to gain new experiences, drives my interest in traveling.

                    As an Indian, I have had the opportunity to travel extensively throughout my country and explore its diverse landscapes, cultures, and heritage. 
                    I have been able to experience the rich history and monuments, the natural beauty of its mountains, beaches, and forests, the vibrant festivals and fairs, and the rich culinary traditions. 
                    I have had the chance to visit iconic sites like the Himalayas and the backwaters of Kerala, as well as lesser-known gems like the North East, and the beaches of Goa. 
                    With a wide range of experiences, I have been able to appreciate the diversity and complexity of my country. I have also had the opportunity to interact with local communities, learn about their way of life, and gain a deeper understanding of India's culture and society. 
                    My travels in India have been a source of inspiration and have helped me to appreciate the beauty and complexity of my own country.

                    As an Indian student in the USA, I have had the opportunity to travel to a few different states. 
                    One of the most memorable experiences was my trip to Alaska to see the Northern Lights. 
                    The natural beauty and the awe-inspiring display of the aurora borealis was truly breathtaking. 
                    I also had the chance to explore the rugged wilderness of the state, and I enjoyed activities like dog sledding and snowmobiling. 
                    Another memorable trip was to the state of Texas. It was my first time visiting the southern part of the USA and I was struck by the contrasts between the urban areas like Houston and the more rural parts of the state like Big Bend. 
                    I also enjoyed the delicious Texan cuisine, I had a great time trying the BBQ, Tex-Mex and other local specialties. It was fascinating to see how different the culture was from what I was used to in India. 
                    My travels to Alaska and Texas have been a great learning experience and helped me to appreciate the diversity and beauty of the United States.
